# TEAM PROFILE GENERATOR

## Your Task

This week i built a web weather app using HTML, CSS, bootstrap,  Java Script and, NODE.JS.  This project helps generate a team page for managers it, takes in the name and personal details of each team member. In this project I made use of the following:

* Inquirer
* Arrays
* Call back functions
* Regular functions
* If/else statements
* Nested Conditional Statements

## Lessons Learned 

* How to use Inquirer to get data from users
* Using the FSwrite to generate external html pages 
* Using jest to test your code to ensure everything passes thereby reducing bugs 


## Challenges 
 * Passing answers into an array
 * Passing all thetest to ensure the function render could work
